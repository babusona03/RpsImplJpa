->Coded to abstraction for JPA, used provider implemented by AS.

->persistence.xml, standalone.xml and pom.xml are crucial, attached in this folder, should be noted as there is no invocation of provider,no dependency attached.

			"	First of all, when using JTA as transaction type, the database connection details 
			shouldn't be in the persistence.xml file. They should be in the standalone.xml from your WilfFly.
			Then the persistence.xml just reference it.	"

->edited default-binding at standalone.xml,other wise , h2 inmem databasewas defaulted to. standalone default and edited copy attached, difference tobe noted.

->jdbc driver and module.xml to be placed at /home/razor/Workshop/server/wildfly-17.0.1.Final/modules/system/layers/base/com/oracle/main

->no jdbc driver at classpath, no dependency in pom. Convension over configuration.
